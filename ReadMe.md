## Websocket Tic-Tac-Toe using Socket.io (Work in Progress)
- Front end is written in React, HTML, CSS
- Backend is written in Node.js, Express and uses the Socket.io library
- For client-server communication the Socket.io library is used and it's underlying technology is websockets(sometimes HTTP long polling)
- This is still a work in progress. Currently implementing a play again feature.


## Trying it out
- If you would like to try it, and I have not yet finished and hosted it, you can clone the repo and do:

        npm install
        nodemon
- Nodemon is a library that reloads the server based on any changes to the files it watches
- Since it will only run locally, you would have to open 2 tabs to be able to play
